# AWS-Cloud-Resume-Challenge-Front-End

As you can probably tell from the title, this is my repository for the front-end of my cloud resume. I have connected this repository with AWS CodePipeline for an active CI/CD flow. 

You can view my cloud resume here: https://resume.richmello.cloud/

I have also blogged about the entire process on Medium. The first post in the series is here: https://medium.com/@devhellomello/the-cloud-resume-challenge-aws-7e2aa731ffd3
